### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Daniel Koralek
This is an experimental and for personal use repository, where I plan to share some shareable snippets of my day to day work.

I'm a Data Engineer by formation, but I consider myself a Data Enthusiast, always trying to lear something new. I'm currently studying the most diverse data pipeline forms and technologies, across different platforms and conditions.

My major experience is around DATA, from big transactional and Data Warehouse modeling, to modern Data Lake and Lake House design (with a special passion for Microsoft Azure data solutions).

I also have a solid (long) background in Software Engineering, so this is something that may appear here as well.
