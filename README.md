### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Daniel Koralek
This is an experimental and for personal use repository, where I plan to share some shareable snippets of my day to day work.

Over the past years I have worked for big and well structured companies, as well a big Unicorn. Eeach company had its data stack, which allowed me to accumulate expertise in different areas and feel comfortable to compare them side by side today.

I'm a Data Engineer by formation, but I consider myself a Data Enthusiast, always trying to lear something new. I'm currently studying the most diverse data pipeline forms and technologies, across different platforms and conditions.

My major experience is around DATA, from big transactional and Data Warehouse modeling, to modern Data Lake and Lake House design (with a special passion for Microsoft Azure data solutions). I also have a solid (long) background in Software Engineering, so this is something that may appear here as well.

#### My knowledge stack
