### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Daniel Koralek
This is an experimental and for personal use repository, where I plan to share some shareable snippets of my day to day work.

I'm a Data Engineer by formation, but I consider myself a Data Enthusiast, always trying to lear something new. I'm currently studying the most diverse data pipeline forms and technologies, across different platforms and conditions.

I also have a solid (long) background in Software Engineering, so this is something that may appear here as well.
