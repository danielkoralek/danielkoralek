### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Daniel Koralek
This is an experimental and personal use repository, where I plan to share some shareable snippets of my day to day work, as well as my personal research findings and self-taught discovery projects.

Over the past years I have worked for big and well structured companies, as well a big Unicorn. Eeach company had its data stack, which allowed me to accumulate expertise in different areas and feel comfortable to compare them side by side today. During this time I have contributed a lot to proprietary projects and private repositories, so most of my old contribution won't show up here.

I'm a Data Engineer by formation, but I consider myself a Data Enthusiast, always trying to lear something new. I'm currently studying the most diverse data pipeline forms and technologies, across different platforms and conditions (based on real-life use cases).

My major experiences are around DATA, from big transactional and Data Warehouse modeling, to modern Data Lake and Lake House design (with a special passion for Microsoft Azure data solutions). I also have a solid (long) background in Software Engineering, so this is something that may appear here as well.
