## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Daniel Koralek
This is my persona GitHub profile where I plan to share some snippets of my day to day work, as well as my personal research findings, and self-taught discovery projects.

Over the past years I have worked for big and well structured companies, as well a big Purple Unicorn. Each company had (has) its technology stack, which allowed me to accumulate experience in different techs and data platforms, and now feel comfortable to compare them side by side. During this time I have contributed a lot to proprietary projects and private repositories, so most of my old contribution won't show up here. 

I'm a Data Engineer by formation, but I consider myself a Data Enthusiast, always trying to lear something new. I'm currently studying the most diverse data pipeline forms and technologies, across different platforms and conditions (based on real-life use cases).

My major experiences are around DATA, from big transactional and Data Warehouse modeling, to modern Data Lake and Lake House design (with a special passion for Microsoft Azure data solutions). I also have a solid (long) background in Software Engineering, so this is something that may appear here as well.

### Cloud knowledge distribution
|Cloud| Knowledge / Experience |
|:--|:--|
| **Microsoft Azure** | Entire data stack, including: Azure Synapse Analytics (from the Workspace management to Pipelines, Dedicated SQL Pool [DW], and Serverless SQL Pool), Azure Data Lake (ADLSGen2), Azure Data Factory, Cosmos DB, Azure Data Explorer, Storage Account, Event Grid, Function Apps. |
| **Google Cloud** | Big Query and some procedures for data ingestion. |
| **Amazon AWS** | S3, Lambdas, Redshift, Redshift Spectrum, CloudWatch. |

### Programming languages skills and experience
| Language | Experience |
|:--|:--|
| **SQL** | Used for everything (beyond programming), all the time, for more than 25 years now. From simple to advanced queries, code-based data modeling, high-performance stored procedures in pure SQL, T-SQL, and PL/SQL. |
| **Java** (OO, mostly SE for backend) | I have not used Java for some time now, but I had a solid Software Engineering with this language in the past, building critical backend and high-performance applications. The most interesting was a telco messaging system, which connected a Billing system to the Cable TV controllers, processing provisioning signals.  |
| **Scala** | Mostly used in Databricks context to build Big d=Data transformations based on Spark processing. Also used a lot of Scala **Functional** programming to contribute to an in-house ELT system running upon Spark. |
| **Python** | All-purpose language for data wrangling, data mockups, quick notebook-based investigations, ingestion pipelines, data analysis, etc. Also used for some automation. |
| **PHP** | I used a lot for dynamic web development and text processing, but it's been a long time I don't go there. |
