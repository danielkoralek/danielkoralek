# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Daniel Koralek
This is my personal GitHub profile where I plan to share some snippets of my day to day work, as well as my personal research findings, and self-taught discovery projects.

Over the past 25+ years I have worked for big and well structured companies, as well as a big purple unicorn. Each company had (has) its technology stack, which allowed me to accumulate experience in different techs and data platforms, and now feel comfortable to compare them side by side. During this time I have contributed a lot to proprietary projects and private repositories, so most of my previous contribution won't show up here. 

I'm a Data Engineer by formation, but I consider myself a **Data Enthusiast**, always trying to lear something new. I'm currently studying the most diverse data pipeline forms and technologies, across different platforms and conditions (based on real-life use cases).

My major experiences are around DATA, from big transactional and Data Warehouse modeling, to modern Data Lake and Lake House design (with a special passion for **Microsoft Azure** data solutions). I also have a solid (long) background as a Software Engineering, so this is something that may appear here as well.

### (Technical) Career path

Although I have played the role of **Team Manager**, **Operations Manager**, **Tech Lead**, and **Squad Lead** at some points in the last few years, the list below is what better describes my career path from the technical stand point:

1. Computer Technician (when I was very very young - AKA the IT boy)
2. Software Developer
3. Web Developer
4. Software Engineer / Architect
5. Database Developer
6. Database Administrator
7. Big Data Developer
8. Analytics Engineer
9. Data Engineer

### Cloud knowledge distribution
|Cloud| Knowledge / Experience |
|:--|:--|
| **Microsoft Azure** | Entire data stack, including: Azure Synapse Analytics (from the Workspace management to Pipelines, Dedicated SQL Pool [DW], and Serverless SQL Pool), Azure Data Lake (ADLSGen2), Azure Data Factory, Cosmos DB, Azure Data Explorer, Storage Account, Event Grid, Function Apps. |
| **Amazon AWS** | S3, Lambdas, Redshift, Redshift Spectrum, CloudWatch, and somewhat Athena. |
| **Google Cloud** | Big Query and some procedures for data ingestion. |

### Programming / Scripting languages skills and experience
| Language | Experience |
|:--|:--|
| **SQL** | Used for everything (beyond programming), all the time, for more than 25 years now. From simple to advanced queries, code-based data modeling, high-performance stored procedures in pure SQL, T-SQL, and PL/SQL. In the past I worked on a huge billing system which was built on top of Oracle PL/SQL with Stored Procedures and Triggers. |
| **Java** (OO, mostly SE for backend) | I have not used Java for some time now, but I had a solid Software Engineering with this language in the past, building critical backend and high-performance applications. The most interesting was a telco messaging system, which connected a Billing system to the Cable TV controllers, processing provisioning signals.  |
| **Scala** | Mostly used in Databricks context to build massive Big Data transformations based on Spark processing. Also used a lot of Scala **Functional** programming to contribute to an in-house ELT system running upon Spark, in a big deta democratization project. |
| **Python** | All-purpose language for data wrangling, data mockups, quick notebook-based investigations, ingestion pipelines, data analysis, etc. Also used for some automation. |
| **Delphi** (OO, for backend development) | For a period in my career I worked on the most state-o-the-art high performance software, fully developed in Delphi, object oriented. It was not created by myself, but I maintained and enhanced it over the time. It was a backend semaphore application for high speed TCP protocol translation which would rule the business of a Cable TV company, sitting at the edge of the hardware communication. |
| **PHP** | I used a lot for dynamic web development, WordPress maintenance and plugin development, and text processing, but it's been a long time I don't go there. |
| **Visual Basic & VB.NET** | Visual Basic was my start point after learning programming with **GW Basic**, a long time ago. With VB I had my first job opportunity working in a Software House building business system suite (mostly Accounting System) based on Visual Basic and the earliest versions of SQL Server. |
| **JavaScript** | Used for applying dynamics to the developed websites, combined with *CSS* and *HTML*. |
